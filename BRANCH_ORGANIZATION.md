## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development:** Work on individual branches
2. **Testing:** Merge branches locally for integration testing
3. **Pull Requests:** Create PRs for each feature branch
4. **Code Review:** Review each feature independently
5. **Integration:** Merge approved features to main

## Partner Collaboration

Each branch is self-contained and can be worked on independently:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal merge conflicts
- Easy to review and test individual features
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance

## Documentation

- `GAMIFICATION_API_DOCS.md` - Complete API documentation
- Each component has inline documentation
- Database schema documented with relationships
